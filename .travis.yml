    # Most likely, you would only want to deploy to npm when a new version of
    # your package is cut. To do this, you can tell Travis CI to only deploy on
    # tagged commits, like so:
    tags: true

    #If you tag a commit locally, remember to run git push --tags to ensure that
    #your tags are uploaded to Github.
    # You can explicitly specify the branch to release from with the on option:
    branch: master

    # After your tests ran and before the release, Travis CI will clean up any
    # additional files and changes you made.
    # Maybe that is not what you want, as you might generate some artifacts that
    # are supposed to be released, too. There is now an option to skip the clean up:
    skip_cleanup: true
